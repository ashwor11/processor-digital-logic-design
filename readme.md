Sometimes logism can act wierd. Our register implementation works without any error. However sometimes when you open the circ file on logisim it gives some bits of the registers "E". It can be solved closing and repoening the circ on logisim until the "E"s changed with "X"s. When all the bits are "X" first opening the circ. Then there is no error on logisim and you can freely use the components.
